# Base

The `base/` folder holds global styles and boilerplate code for the project. In here, you will find resets, typographic rules, and a stylesheet (usually called `_base.scss`) to define standard styles for common HTML elements.

*Note: When using resets, remember there is no need to include Normalize.css because Bulma has its own mini reset. Generally, this stylesheet is helpful for resetting styles defined by the content management system.*
